<b>***Android Marshmallow (6.0) users***</b>: it looks like you can finally use normal SMS apps, so this app is no longer essential for Marshmallow.
<br />

Since you are here, you probably noticed that on the <b>Nexus 7 3G/LTE</b> edition, you can't send/receive SMS messages, hindering the ability for many to subscribe/change options on various prepay providers.
<br />

You can now finally send and receive SMS messages from your Nexus 7 tablet! (as long as it has a SIM and a carrier plan with included texts, of course)
